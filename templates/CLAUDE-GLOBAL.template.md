# Global Rules - Shared Across All Projects

This file contains rules and guidelines that apply to **ALL** your projects.
When you edit this file, changes will be automatically:
- Synced to GitHub as CLAUDE.md
- Propagated to all registered workspaces

## Common Rules

Add your global rules here. Examples:

### Commit Message Format
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed description in commit body when needed

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (tabs vs spaces)
- Follow language-specific style guides
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names

### Documentation
- Update README when adding features
- Document public APIs
- Keep comments up-to-date

**Note:** Project-specific rules go in `CLAUDE-PROJECT.md` (not synced to GitHub)
