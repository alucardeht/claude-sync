## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### File Organization

```
claude-sync/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/           # CLI entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/           # Core functionality
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.js  # Configuration management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git.js     # Git operations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/     # Configuration templates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/         # Test files (if added)
```

### Code Quality

- **No console.log**: Use proper logging (chalk, ora)
- **Error handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Async/await**: Prefer async/await over callbacks
- **Validation**: Validate user inputs
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself

### Example Good Code

```javascript
async function addWorkspace(workspacePath) {
  try {
    if (!workspacePath) {
      throw new Error('Workspace path is required');
    }

    const normalizedPath = path.resolve(workspacePath);

    if (!fs.existsSync(normalizedPath)) {
      throw new Error(`Path does not exist: ${normalizedPath}`);
    }

    // Add workspace logic...

    return normalizedPath;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(chalk.red(`Failed to add workspace: ${error.message}`));
    throw error;
  }
}
```
